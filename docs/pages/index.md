# Welcome to Flumix Documentation

A simple lisp like programming language

## Features

Flumix is a versatile and expressive programming language inspired by Lisp. It combines the power of symbolic expressions (S-expressions) with modern programming paradigms to provide a unique and flexible development experience. Here are some of the key features that set Flumix apart:

- S-expression Syntax: Flumix uses the iconic S-expression syntax, characterized by nested parentheses and symbols. This syntax provides a uniform representation for both code and data, enabling code manipulation and metaprogramming with ease.
- Dynamic Typing: In Flumix, variables are dynamically typed, allowing for flexible and agile development. Types are determined at runtime, enabling rapid prototyping and reducing the need for explicit type declarations.
- Garbage Collection: Flumix features automatic memory management through garbage collection. This ensures efficient memory usage and helps prevent memory leaks, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about memory management.
- Macros: Take advantage of the macro system in Flumix to define custom syntax and perform code transformations at compile-time. Macros empower developers with metaprogramming capabilities, enabling the creation of domain-specific languages and expressive code.
